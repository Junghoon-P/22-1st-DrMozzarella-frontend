The cheese markets in Alkmaar, Gouda and Edam remind us of the origins of a flourishing cheese trade and have become popular tourist attractions. The Dutch still love cheese and eat about seven pounds of it annually per person. Just like Julius Caesar, let yourself be surprised about the many types of Dutch cheeses and sample the country's \"yellow gold\"."
